## Overview
A collection of scripts made for personal use in the game ArmA 3. If you find them useful, feel free to use them. All of my scripts assume a file structure within a mission folder (Arma 3\missions\<mission folder>\Scripts) that contains this separate folder named "Scripts". This will be referenced in example calls within the header as "\Scripts\<script name>.sqf". If you wish to forego this, just leave it in the root of the mission folder and call it as "<script name>.sqf". This, however, is not recommended for organizational purposes.
